Period: Half-open interval: includes the beginning, excludes the end.
Impression: The number of people that may see an interaction. A like will be seen by all the friends of the person who liked. A tweet will be seen by all the followers of the person who tweeted.

facebook_personas has a friends_count column.
twitter_personas has a followers_count column.

Social Impressions == SUM(number_of_interactions * friends_count)

Problem
-------

Calculate the top 5 shows, ordered by social impressions, for the period between 2011-10-17 and 2011-10-23.

Subtleties
----------

* Two types of personas: Twitter and Facebook
* When followers_count or friends_count is 0, we use a default of 130

Constraints
